# map
The purpose of this repository is to build a python application in which the user can visualize a map of the world and add a marker to all the places he / she wants to see or has already seen.

The library I used to create the map is not as responsive as i thought it would be, so I may implement another version of this project in the future with a different library or maybe I  will use a totally different approach.
